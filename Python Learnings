# Commonly used notebook shortcuts

Once you are in command mode (that is, you don’t have an active cell), you can try out the below shortcuts:

A will insert a new cell above the active cell, and B will insert one below the active cell
To delete a cell, press D twice in succession
To undo a deleted cell, press Z
Y turns the currently active cell into a code cell
Hold down Shift + the up or down arrow key to select multiple cells. While in multiple selection mode, pressing Shift + M will merge your selection
F will pop up the ‘Find and Replace’ menu


When in edit mode (press Enter when in command mode to get into Edit mode), you will find the below shortcuts handy:

Ctrl + Home to go the start of the cell
Ctrl + S will save your progress
As mentioned, Ctrl + Enter will run your entire cell block
Alt + Enter will not only run your cell block, it also adds a new cell below
Ctrl + Shift + F opens the command palette
