1. Open Source
2. Interpreter, no compiling required
3. No need to define the variables
4. Scripting language like PERL, Java Script, Ruby
5. Case Sensitive
6. Anaconda 4.2.0 and Python 3.5.2 is used
7. Way of execution
> python Hello.py
or
> ./Hello.py

8. Inputs through command line are taken into below variables of python code

>import sys
 sys.argv is the variable

9. Python.Org is official site, with the documentation
10. Strings can have Single quote or Double Quotes ‘ / “ 
11. Operators :- or, and, not
12. Built in Functions or Methods Examples:-

> var.lower()
> var.find()  —> considers first char as position 0
> Lot of build-in functions

13. Exercises string1.py and string2.py
   Ref code:
14. List of Rstudio = Tuple of Python
15. list.sort() does not return, where as Sorted() function returns the values
16. Tuples are immutable, we can reassign a value, instead we can replace the value.
17. DICT={} very powerful keyword to build keys and for grouping.
18. Assignment does not create a copy.

	a = [1,3,4,5]
	b = a 

	both a and b point to same memory. b is not a copy of a.

	For copying:
	b = a[:]


Advantage of Python:
1. Variables need not be defined upfront

Downside of Python:
1. if a code is incorrectly coded, unless that piece of code is executed, program will never throw error message
	
	Ex: Unless name is ‘Guido’, repeeet will not shown as 		error.
	 def main():
    		if name == 'Guido':
        			print repeeeet(name) + '!!!'
   		 else:
      			  print repeat(name)
2. if a built in variable is used as program variable, then built in variable function will be overridden, and it results in inadvertent results. Python won’t warn.

3. a and b variables point to the same memory location. Data is not copied to b.

	a = [‘red’,’blue’,’orange’]
	b = a
4. list methods modifies the ORIGINAL LIST, it does not return. Many useful list methods are available https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists

	list.extend(“abcd”)
	list.remove(“abcd”)
	list.append(‘abcd’)
	list.sort()

Where to Look for Help:

1. Google Search
2. docs.python.org  documentation
3. Stackoverflow or Quora
4. help on python command line
5. https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor
